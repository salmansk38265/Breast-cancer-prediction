# Breast-cancer-prediction
This project uses a machine learning model to predict breast cancer diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) based on the features extracted from breast cancer tumor cells. The dataset used in this project contains features such as the radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness of the tumor cells.
